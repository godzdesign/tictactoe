# tictactoe
This was a coding practice I saw somewhere. It's a TicTacToe game that you can play in your terminal.
In the future I want to make that game playable in a window / in the web browser to practice my HTML/CSS and JS coding skills.

How to play?

Step 1:install node.js https://nodejs.org/en or check version with 'node -v' in your terminal

Step 2: install 'npm install prompt-sync' because of 'const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();' (no regular module)

Step 3: To start write in your terminal: 'node tictactoe.js'

Have Fun!
